    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this codelab, you'll learn about how to use convolutional neural Networks to improve your image classification models. You'll build on the model from [lab 2](), using the convolutions learned from [lab 3]()!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Before you begin...\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be using TensorFlow in this lab to add convolutional layers to the top of a deep neural network (DNN) that you created in an earlier [lab]()\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never done this before, it's strongly recommend you use Google Colaboratory, a browser-based environment that contains all the required dependencies, including TensorFlow and the required libraries. You can find the code for the rest of this lab running in a colab [here]().\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, the main language you will use for training models is Python, so you will need to have that installed. In addition to that, you'll also need to [install TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install). You'll also need the [numpy](https://numpy.org/) library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Improving computer vision accuracy using convolutions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous labs you saw how to do fashion image recognition using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) containing three layers -- the input layer (in the shape of the input data), the output layer (in the shape of the desired output) and a hidden layer. You experimented with several parameters that influence the final accuracy, such as different sizes of hidden layers and number of training epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, here's the entire code again. Run it and take a note of the test accuracy that is printed out at the end."

    "Your accuracy is probably about 89% on training and 87% on validation But how do you make that even better? One way is to use something called convolutions, which narrowsdown the content of the image to focus on specific, distinct details.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever done [image processing using a filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)) then convolutions will look very familiar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, you take an array (usually 3x3 or 5x5) and pass it over the image. By changing the underlying pixels based on the formula within that matrix, you can perform operations like edge detection. So, for example, in the image processing link, notice that a 3x3 is defined for edge detection where the middle cell is 8, and all of its neighbors are -1. In this case, for each pixel, you would multiply its value by 8, then subtract the value of each neighbor. Do this for every pixel, and you'll end up with a new image that has its edges enhanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is perfect for computer vision, because often its features that can get highlighted like this to help distinguish one item for another. Better still, the amount of information needed is much less, because you'll train only on the highlighted features.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks. Add some layers to do convolution before you have the dense layers, and then the information going to the dense layers becomes more focused and possibly more accurate.\n"

If you don't do this, you'll get an error when training as the convolutions do not recognize the shape."

The idea is that it creates a 2x2 array of pixels and picks the largest pixel value, thus turning 4 pixels into 1.

The print (test_labels[;100]) shows us the first 100 labels in the test set, and you can see that the ones at index 0, index 23 and index 28 are all the same value (9). They're all shoes. Let's take a look at the result of running the convolution on each, and you'll begin to see common features between them emerge. Now, when the DNN is training on that data, it's working with a lot less information, and it's perhaps finding a commonality between shoes based on this convolution/pooling combination."
